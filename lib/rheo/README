This directory has a Makefile.lammps file with settings that allows LAMMPS to
dynamically link to the GSL library.  This is required to use the RHEO package
in a LAMMPS input script.  If you have the pkg-config command available, it
will automatically import the GSL settings. Otherwise they will have to be
added manually.

See the header of Makefile.lammps for more info.
